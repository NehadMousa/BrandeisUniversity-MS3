## TRANSFORMING AND AUGMENTING IMAGES
Transforms are common image transformations available in the torchvision.transforms module. They can be chained together using Compose. Most transform classes have a function equivalent: functional transforms give fine-grained control over the transformations. This is useful if you have to build a more complex transformation pipeline (e.g. in the case of segmentation tasks).
